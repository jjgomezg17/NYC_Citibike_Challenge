# NYC_Citibike_Challenge

## Overview of the Analysis

#### [Results of the Project](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/juan.gomez7491/viz/NYCStory_16750493507430/Story1)

#### I performed a bike trip analysis to solidify the business proposal for a bike-sharing program in Des Moines. One of the key stakeholders requested this analysis to provide further evidence that this program would be a viable business opportunity. Using Pandas, I first transformed the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. This allowed me to create several visualizations that showed important information about the use of the bikes.

#### I created a set of visualizations to show the length of time that bikes were checked out for all riders and genders. This provided insights into the average trip duration for different groups of riders and helped us understand their needs and habits. Additionally, I created visualizations that showed the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week. This allowed us to identify the busiest times for bike usage and how it varied based on the day of the week and the rider's gender.

#### Finally, I created visualizations that showed the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week. This information was important in understanding the different types of riders and how their usage varied based on the day of the week. I added these new visualizations to the two I created earlier in the project to create a comprehensive presentation and analysis. I presented this to the investors to demonstrate the potential success of the bike-sharing program in Des Moines.

#### This pattern of trips between popular tourist destinations highlights the potential for a bike-sharing program in NYC. These locations have a high volume of foot traffic and visitors, making them prime locations for bike-sharing stations. By having bike-sharing stations located at these popular destinations, the program would be able to cater to the needs of tourists as well as local residents who are looking for a convenient mode of transportation.

#### Moreover, the fact that the top ending locations are similar to the top starting locations suggests that there is a high demand for round-trip trips. This indicates that people are using bikes not only for leisure, but also for commuting and running errands. This demonstrates the versatility of bike-sharing services and the potential for the program to grow and expand in the future.

#### The bike trip analysis confirms that the city of NYC has a strong demand for bike-sharing services. The high volume of trips between popular tourist destinations and the increase in demand during peak tourist season highlights the potential for success and profitability of a bike-sharing program in NYC.

### Checkout Times for Users

#### Furthermore, the checkout times for users analysis supports the idea that bike-sharing is a popular mode of transportation for commuting and running errands. With most trips taking approximately 10 minutes, it shows that people are using bikes for short distances and quick errands. This highlights the convenience and ease of using bike-sharing services and the potential for it to be a popular mode of transportation in NYC.

#### Additionally, the checkout times analysis also shows that there is a high demand for bike-sharing services during peak hours, such as the morning and afternoon rush hour. This indicates that people are using bikes as a convenient and efficient mode of transportation to and from work or other daily activities.

#### In conclusion, the checkout times analysis supports the findings of the bike trip analysis and confirms the potential for a bike-sharing program in NYC. The high demand for bike-sharing services during peak hours and the popularity of using bikes for short trips and errands highlights the potential for success and profitability of the program.

### Trips by Weekday per Hour

#### This data on the hours in which trips are made according to the day of the week highlights the potential for a bike-sharing program in NYC. The high demand for bike-sharing services during peak hours, such as the morning and afternoon rush hour, indicates that people are using bikes as a convenient and efficient mode of transportation to and from work or other daily activities.

#### The trend of high demand for bike-sharing services during weekends between 9 am and 9 pm suggests that people are using bikes for leisure and recreation. With a high number of trips originating from areas outside of the city's tourist destinations, it indicates that people are using bikes to explore and enjoy the city.

#### In conclusion, the data on the hours in which trips are made according to the day of the week further supports the findings of the bike trip analysis and checkout times analysis. The high demand for bike-sharing services during peak hours and during weekends highlights the potential for success and profitability of a bike-sharing program in NYC.

### Checkout Times by Genders

## Summary

#### The results of the bike trip analysis in Des Moines showed the length of time that bikes were checked out for all riders and genders, the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week, and the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

#### It was found that most trips go from one relevant or famous location to another, with the highest travel use evident on weekends between 9 am and 9 pm and on working days between 6 am and 9 am and 5 pm and 7 pm. The majority of users are men, and the data on the time of day and gender of bike-sharing users highlights the similarities and differences between the two groups. The data on the weekday and gender of bike-sharing users highlights the behavior patterns of different groups of riders.

#### For future analysis, two additional visualizations could be created. One could be a map visualization of the top starting and ending locations over time, with the frequency of trips being represented by the size of the markers. This would give a more visual representation of the location-based data and help to identify areas where demand is highest depeding on the time.

#### Another visualization could be a line graph showing the trend in the number of bike trips over time, with different lines representing different user groups and genders. This would help to identify any seasonal trends or changes in demand and provide valuable information for future planning and optimization of the bike-sharing program.

#### In conclusion, the bike trip analysis provided valuable insights into the behavior patterns of bike-sharing users in Des Moines and can inform future marketing and outreach efforts, as well as program optimization.
